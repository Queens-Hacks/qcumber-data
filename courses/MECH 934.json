        "description": "The objective of this course is to teach students to understand the potential and limitations of Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD), develop advanced solution methods for fluid-dynamics problems, and run commercial software in a critical manner. The course begins by presenting various forms of numerical approximations of the governing equations. An in-depth analysis of iterative methods to solve linear systems will follow. Numerical methods for the solution of the Navier-Stokes equations will be presented, with emphasis on numerical stability and on conservation properties. Three term-hours lectures.",
