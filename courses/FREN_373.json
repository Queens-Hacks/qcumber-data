        "description": "In this course, we examine the syntax of standard French and of Canadian French from a generative grammar perspective. The study of syntax will be explained, as well as the various properties of language that form the object of syntactic analysis. We will discover what a grammatical theory can show us about the grammar of French and consider some specific questions raised by the syntax of Canadian French.\nLEARNING HOURS\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 120 (36L;84P)",
