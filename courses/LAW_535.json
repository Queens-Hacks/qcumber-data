        "description": "This seminar examines equality rights jurisprudence under the Charter by asking whether the new \u00bfcompeting rights\u00bf analysis advances or limits the rights of equality-seekers. Since women argued strenuously for enhanced equality rights during the debates leading up to the adoption of the Charter, many but not all of the cases we review will involve women whether as equality-seekers or as objects of state protection.",
