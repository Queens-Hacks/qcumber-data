        "description": "This course deals with the application of deterministic mathematical models to management decision-making. Topics will include: the identification and formulation of decision models; the use of marginal analysis in basic problems of pricing and inventory control; the application of mathematical programming models in multivariate resource allocation; and the use of network models in transportation analysis, planning, and project management. Computer modeling and solution techniques will be discussed throughout the course, with emphasis on spreadsheet-based methods. A particular focus will be the interpretation and communication of model results.\u00a0 This course restricted to students enrolled in the 2nd year or higher of the Commerce Program.",
