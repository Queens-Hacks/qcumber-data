        "description": "Business practices play a major role in shaping the context for engineering projects. The aim of the course, through readings, lectures, individual assignments and quizzes is to provide insight into the business and economic aspects of engineering by examining the issues relating to the management of people, time & money and provide the tools required to solve basic economic questions faced by an engineer. Factors underlying the success and failure of projects will be highlighted. Business Planning, Project Management and Engineering Economics are closely related, but vast subjects. The scope of this course will be limited to the topics covered in the textbook \"Engineering Economics, Second Custom Edition for Queen's University\", along with supplemental material provided on the class website.",
