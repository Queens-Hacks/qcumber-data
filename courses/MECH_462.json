However, new projects can be the subject of MECH 462 as long as they meet the \"implement and operate\" objectives of the course.\u00a0 An engineering report is prepared and defended. The presentation is normally supported by a working prototype or physical mock-up of the design. Testing a process or system can replace the building of a prototype.",
