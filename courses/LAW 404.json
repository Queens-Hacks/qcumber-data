The pre-trial section includes police power to search and arrest, legal and illegal police discretion, show cause hearings (bail), the right to counsel, prosecutional powers and discretion and plea bargaining. Trial topics are jurisdiction, election, formal objections, joint trials, pleas, the doctrine of included offences, double jeopardy, preliminary inquiries, direct indictment, discovery and the unique features of trial by jury. At the post-trial stage, sentence and appellate options and the prerogative writs are briefly explored.4 credits, fall term.",
