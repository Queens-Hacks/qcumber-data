        "description": "The aim of this course is to highlight the influence of snow and ice on weathering reactions, nutrient cycling, contaminant transport, and global biogeochemistry. The course will investigate the physical, chemical and biological processes that govern the chemistry of surface waters (precipitation, ice, soil solutions, and streams) in glacial and seasonally snow-covered environments.",
