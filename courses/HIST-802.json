        "description": "This course is a combined senior undergraduate/graduate-level seminar on the history of historical writing in various parts of the world at different periods from antiquity to the current era.\u00a0 Traditional courses such as this focus on a number of canonical \"great\" historians, and these are almost invariably drawn from the western tradition.\u00a0 While due attention will be paid to Western historiography from Herodotus on, we will also be examining the historical writing of understudied parts of Europe, of China, Japan, South and Southeast Asia, and Latin America.\u00a0 Some attention will also be paid to alternative forms of historical commemoration, such as indigenous beliefs about the past.\u00a0 The intent is thus both to familiarize the student with the \"origins\" of the current discipline and to place the western theory and practice of history into a much broader and comparative context.",
