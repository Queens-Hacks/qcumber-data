        "description": "This course examines econometric problems specific to the field of management. Despite the existence of rich theoretical frameworks, intriguing and persistent empirical puzzles have evolved around the strategic choices made by firms and around why seemingly well-devised strategies can fail to create value. Recent methodological advances have allowed scholars to delve deeper into understanding organizational behavior and to better model unobserved or omitted factors that can confound the interpretation of results. This is an applied course examining techniques that are important while modeling choice, performance, and survival in the organizational context. Sessions will typically involve a brief review of selected studies, and overview of the underlying methodologies, and hands-on application exercises. As part of the course, students will also have the opportunity to discuss and advance their own studies. (1.5 credit units)",
