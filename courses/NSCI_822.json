(same as ANAT 822\u00a0 and PHGY 822) Topics will include cable properties of dendrites, voltage- and ligand-dependent channels, and molecular mechanisms responsible for neuronal death and regeneration. The course will be based on lectures and student seminars of selected readings. Given concurrently with LISC-422*, with additional assignments for graduate students.One hour lecture/week, 2 hour seminar/week: winter. K. Rose. (Offered in years ending in an even number)",
