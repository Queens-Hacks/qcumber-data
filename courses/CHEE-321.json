        "description": "An introduction to the principles of chemical kinetics, and reactor analysis and design. The topics in chemical kinetics include: rate constants, reaction order, rate equations for elementary and complex reactions, kinetic data analysis, and product distribution. In reactor analysis and design, discussion is focused on ideal reactor systems and arrangements, including batch reactors, plug flow reactors, continuous stirred tank reactors, and recycle reactors. The last part of the course considers homogeneous and heterogeneous catalytic reactions. The design component consists of how to make an appropriate choice of reactor type and operating conditions to optimize a desired product; sizing such reactors and determining conversion levels under various conditions of temperature and pressure; determination of reaction kinetics from experimental data.",
