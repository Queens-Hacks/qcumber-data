        "description": "Doing business in developing countries is one of the hottest topics on today's business agenda. Whether it is the opportunities of selling to vast and growing markets-the so called \"fortune at the bottom of the pyramid\"-or the prospects of dramatically lower costs through outsourcing, business leaders are interested in developing country markets as never before. This broad-ranging course aims to apply the tools of economics and international business to understand the opportunities and pitfalls of doing business in developing-country environments. The course will focus on a range of practical business-focused questions, but it will also bring students to the frontier of debates in development economics and business ethics. Topics include:\u00a0 Assessing opportunities and challenges in emerging markets; building capabilities for doing business in weak institutional environments; debates among leading schools of thought on development; and the roles and responsibilities of profit-seeking businesses. The course should be of interest to students interested in development economics, international business and business ethics.PREREQUISITE\u00a0\u00a0 COMM 172 or permission of the instructor.",
