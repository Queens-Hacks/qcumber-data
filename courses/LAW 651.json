The proposal process under the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act and the plan of arrangement process under the Companies\u00bf Creditors Arrangement Act will be examined in some detail. The distinctions between restructuring the entity and restructuring the enterprise in a different entity will be explored.\u00a0 The role and limits of judicial discretion in the development of this area of law will be examined critically.\u00a0 The limits on operational restructuring and the uses of alternative tools, such as a sale by a receiver or liquidations conducted under the CCAA without any plan of arrangement, will be explored. International and cross-border insolvency cases and European Union and United States approaches to these issues will also be considered. The course will include a major written requirement.3 credits, winter termMr. Jones",
