Distribution of the elements, and practical uses of isotopes and elemental tracers. Geochemical actions and transactions within, and among, the lithosphere, hydrosphere, atmosphere and biosphere, including the impact of human evolution and environmental geochemistry. Practical application of geochemistry to solving problems in natural systems will be emphasized. A practical involving problems, laboratory experience and field experience will be part of the course.",
