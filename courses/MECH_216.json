        "description": "This course is composed of active lab modules that provide hands-on practical experience to complement the theory presented in MECH 215. On completion of the course, students will be able to: Install and test a micro controller system for data acquisition and control; Acquire and process digital and analog data; Apply transducers for temperature, pressure, stress, strain and force; position, velocity and acceleration; Formulate conclusions supported by data and comparison of results to appropriate models; Discuss the limitations of data employed, key findings, trends evident, uncertainty and error; Create graphs, tables and charts to clearly present data and support conclusions; Compose technical writing to concisely report measurement results and draw valid conclusions. Students will use experimental and numerical skills typically acquired in MTHE 272 and MECH 215.",
