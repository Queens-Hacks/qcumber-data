The format is to be very flexible but pre-planned. For example, candidates may chose to do a series of half-days, or three full-time weeks, or a combination of half-days, full-days and/or full weeks. Full-time weeks may be done during the fall or winter reading weeks, or (if necessary) at the end of the term in May, or a reasonable combination of these options.",
