        "description": "This course supports scholarly and personal understanding of teaching and learning abroad as teacher candidates prepare for professional practice in international settings. The focus will be on theories that support teachers in their understanding of the complexities associated with teaching in cross-cultural contexts, such as cultural variables, \"third culture kids\", service learning, professional development and diversity consciousness. These will be discussed by drawing on current literature in the field of overseas teaching and cross-cultural teaching and learning. Candidates will learn through structured classes, group discussions, guest speakers and personal research of topics specifically applicable to individual interests. This course helps candidates understand teaching and learning in ELL, multicultural, and diverse contexts in Canada or abroad.",
