        "description": "Analog and digital electronic circuits based on the devices introduced in ELEC 252 will be studied. The course is subdivided into two parts; the design and operation of amplifiers and the operation of common logic families. Particular attention is paid to the transient and frequency response of the circuits. The course also includes a study of feedback as applied to the design and analysis of electronic circuits. The laboratory work is design oriented and complements the lecture material.",
