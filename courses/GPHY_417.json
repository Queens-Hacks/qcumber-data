This course will explore the methods used to quantify rates of land-use and land-cover change, and also the biophysical consequences of these changes. The goal of the course is to develop a framework for evaluating the biophysical and societal trade-offs associated with land-use decisions.\nNOTE\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Field trip fees may apply in certain years.\nLEARNING HOURS\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 131 (30L;41Oc;60P)",
