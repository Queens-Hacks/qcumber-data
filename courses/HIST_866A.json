        "description": "This course examines the history of race relations in Latin America from European contact to the present day, focussing on the significant indigenous and African contribution to the complex multiethnic societies of Mexico, Central and South America. Major topics include indigenous resistance and adaptation to conquest and colonial rule, long-standing debates about assimilation versus cultural survival, and contemporary struggles over land, resources, and identity. The course also looks at slavery, emancipation, and the cultural contribution of Africans to modern Latin America, and at the much-debated assertion that Latin America provides a unique and less conflictual model of race relations.
