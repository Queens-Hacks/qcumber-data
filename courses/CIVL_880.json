        "description": "This course deals with subsurface contamination by hazardous industrial liquids such as PCB oils, gasoline, jet fuel, chlorinated solvents and coal tars. The fundamentals of multiphase/multicomponent flow and transport will be outlined followed by specific treatments of both dense and light non-aqueous phase liquids. The course will examine the subsurface distribution of these liquids, sampling and detection, clean-up technologies, regulatory aspects, and selected case histories. (CIVL-480 plus additional material.) Three term-hours.",
