        "description": "This class review central dilemmas in antidiscrimination law. Although the idea that discrimination is wrong is quite intuitive, translating it into applicable legal norms has turned out to be challenging for many legal systems. The class will examine the core commitments and rationales of this field, aiming to provide an understanding of the its underlying ideas.\u00a0\u00a0 \r\n \nQuestions explored include: To what extent and in what contexts should the law require that private actors avoid discrimination? What criteria should be use to compose the list of forbidden grounds for discrimination? Should such a list be closed, or should it be open for judicial supplementations? Is it sufficient to ban discrimination ex post, or is there a need ex ante mechanisms to help prevent it? Should antidiscrimination law care about treating people differently based on physical appearance, or does this area of personal interaction fall outside its mandate? And should there be different degrees of judicial scrutiny depending on the social group in question?\u00a0 \r\n \nThe class will rely on examples and case studies from diverse national and international sources. It is thus not designed to familiarize students with the doctrine of a particular legal system, but to provide tools for analysing and evaluating antidiscrimination law in any jurisdictional context.",
