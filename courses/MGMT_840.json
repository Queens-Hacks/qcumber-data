Course readings focus on topics related to marketing strategy and marketing management. Marketing strategy consists of the knowledge, concepts and processes that allow firms to evolve and survive in a competitive environment including, the analysis of markets, the allocation of resources for the creation of superior customer value and the creation of a competitive advantage.
