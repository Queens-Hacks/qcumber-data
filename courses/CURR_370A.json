        "description": "This course explores the relationship between theory and practice of teaching mathematics in the Intermediate and Senior levels. Integrating relevant ideas and content from psychology, sociology and mathematics education, the course provides teacher candidates with the opportunities to develop a critical appraisal of curriculum documents and associated professional resources. Teacher candidates will engage in collaborative activities that give them opportunities to move from a concern about teaching into a concern about the impact on students' learning. An integrated approach to the teaching and learning of mathematics considers technology, diverse teaching and learning strategies, the nature of assessment and evaluation of student mathematics achievement, and current trends in classroom practice.",
