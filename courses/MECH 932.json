Among the main topics considered are: Analysis of laminar and turbulent free convective flows; local similarity methods in heat transfer; heat transfer with film condensation; prediction of turbulent Prandtl numbers; mixed (or combined) convection; combined heat and mass transfer; heat transfer in compressible flows. Three term hours, lectures. P.H. Oosthuizen",
