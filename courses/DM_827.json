        "description": "The world is faced with severe negative consequences of the present non-renewable energy systems. Carbon dioxide (CO2) concentration in the atmosphere is constantly increasing and the effects of global warming are becoming more evident. There is a growing awareness of the opportunities and potential impact that renewable energy technologies and management may have in the short and longer term. The course covers the fundamentals of different renewable energy systems (RES) including biomass, hydropower, geothermal, wind, solar thermal and photovoltaics. It covers the basics of performance and economic analysis of RES. It also covers the use of RES in achieving sustainability in high performance green buildings and details of the LEED rating system for new construction and existing buildings. The course also introduces the use of computer programs for simulating and analyzing RES. (Lead Instructor: Mohamed S. Hamed, McMaster University)",
