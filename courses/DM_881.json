        "description": "Technological entrepreneurship involves much more than having a good business idea and writing a solid business plan. This course will introduce new venture creation as a process intimately connected to new product innovation and design. The successful introduction of a new product or service within an existing or new business requires several important steps: identification, evaluation, and selection of opportunities; planning and financing the new venture or project; and executing the new venture or project plan. A combination of lectures, assignments, and experienced guest speakers will be used to explore each of these steps in a practical manner that will be interesting and useful to any professional engineer, entrepreneur, or manager.(Lead Instructor:\u00a0 Joel Adams, Western Ontario)",
