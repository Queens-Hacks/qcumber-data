        "description": "An introduction to the use of mathematics in economic analysis. The first part of the course will concentrate on techniques for constrained and unconstrained optimization, as applied to problems of firm and consumer behaviour. This will lead to the interpretation of Lagrange multipliers as shadow prices. The second part of the course will show how matrix algebra may be used to study problems of production and allocation in interdependent economies.\nLEARNING HOURS\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 120 (36L;84P)",
