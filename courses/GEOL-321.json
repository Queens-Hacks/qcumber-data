        "description": "Application of material mechanics to rock deformation. The nature, origin and interpretation of deformation and fracture of rocks, and the application of structural methods to site-investigation and resource exploitation. Topics include geometric, kinematic and dynamic analysis; mechanical analysis (stress and strain theory); geologic mapping and map interpretation; engineering rockmass classification and rock engineering in structurally controlled ground, introduction to geotectonics with examination of selected tectonic associations. Application of structural geology and geomechanics to design issues related to construction, mining, natural hazards, and resource exploitation. \nNOTE\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Required full-day field trip and several half day excursions.\nLEARNING HOURS\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 122 (36L;18Lb;8Oc;60P)",
