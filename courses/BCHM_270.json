The course will provide self-paced learning and utilize evidence-based teaching principles, small group learning, peer-learning and guided-independent learning methodologies to provide an inclusive learning environment. Students will gain an enhanced appreciation of general applications of biochemistry as applied in day to day healthy life and during the disease states, diagnosis and clinical management of metabolic disorders.\nNOTE\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Only offered online. Consult Continuing and Distance Studies.\nNOTE\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This introductory biochemistry online course is intended for prospective students in Nursing, Environmental Sciences, Engineering, Commerce, and general science programs.\nNOTE\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 May not be taken for credit towards the Plan requirements of the BCHM or LISC Specialization or Major Plans.\nLEARNING HOURS\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 126 (66O;60P)",
