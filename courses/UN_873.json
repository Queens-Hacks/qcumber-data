        "description": "This course combines an in-depth study of regulation of nuclear power reactors with a module on the broad aspects of energy in society. It begins with an overall analysis of a regulated nuclear power industry, including why regulators are needed, their characteristics and qualities, and the impacts on industry of operating in a highly-regulated environment. Using practices from the USA, the UK, and Canada, it compares (through each stage of a plant life-cycle) prescriptive, goal-oriented, and risk informed regulation. Canadian regulatory requirements are explored in depth as a specific example. The final module examines the broader role of energy in society: how it is used, its characteristics, energy mixes, and the specific role of nuclear energy.\r\nPREREQUISITE: permission of instructor",
