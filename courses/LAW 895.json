        "description": "This course will explore the role of law as a coercive institution. In particular, we will focus on the most drastic and most obvious institution of state coercion \u00bf the criminal law. In order to understand this role better, we will explore two related themes: the primacy of legal rules and the secondary, supporting function of punishment; and the importance of ideas of fault and responsibility in criminal law. In order to understand the later discussion of punishment, fault and responsibility, we will begin with an introduction to the structure of law as a system of rules. We will distinguish traditional notions of punishments as threats (Austin) or prices (Holmes) and the response of H.L.A. Hart in The Concept of Law emphasizing the centrality and independence of legal rules. We then move to the central problems concerning fault and responsibility in Canadian criminal law. We will focus particularly on two issues: the application of objective fault standards and the appropriate structure of defenses such as self-defense, duress and necessity. In this discussion, we will also consider how and why we ought to treat the concept of fault differently in the criminal and civil contexts. (To be offered jointly with LAW-399.)
