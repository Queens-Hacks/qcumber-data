        "description": "The purpose of this course is to begin an inquiry into mathematics teaching and learning that will guide you in your first teaching experiences and give you tools that will enable you to continue to inquire and learn as part of your work as a teacher. Traditionally, an intermediate mathematics curriculum course would have been designed to teach pre-service teachers how to teach the content of the mathematics lessons they experienced as middle-school students. But current national reforms in mathematics education are recommending that middle school teachers think in new ways about the content of their instruction (what to teach) and pedagogy (how to teach). This course is intended to launch you as a learner and teacher of mathematics in ways that correlate with new directions in mathematics curriculum. The purpose of this course is to help you learn to think of the mathematics you will teach from the perspective of the student who is learning. You will have the opportunity to explore the teaching of mathematics through investigating how students learn mathematics in the areas of whole numbers, rational numbers, measurement, geometry, probability, and algebra. The goal is to begin to help you develop ways of thinking about mathematics, about students, and about the teaching and learning of mathematics in each of these areas.",
