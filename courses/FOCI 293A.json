        "description": "The International Baccalaureate (IB) and Advanced Placement (AP) are internationally recognized and externally assessed gifted education programs offered in many international schools and independent (private) schools across Canada, as well as increasing numbers of publicly funded secondary schools in Ontario and other jurisdictions across Canada. This course provides teacher candidates with an introduction to both of these programs. Course participants will explore specific IB and/or AP courses in relation to their respective subject/discipline areas of interest. This course endeavours to match candidates with an IB or AP placement for their alternative practicum. The expectation is that candidates will, through this course, have an opportunity to be introduced to IB and AP programs, and then to become immersed in one of these programs in their alternate practicum experience.\u00a0",
